# Findings from Testing

## Functional Testing

### Positive Test Cases
- All positive test cases passed successfully.
- The API handled valid requests as expected, returning appropriate responses and status codes.

### Negative Test Cases
- Identified an issue where the API does not return a specific error code for missing parameters.
- The system handled non-existent job status requests correctly by returning a 404 status.

## Performance Testing

### Results
- The API performed well under load, with an average response time of 200ms for creating Finetune jobs.
- Throughput was consistent, with no significant degradation in performance up to 50 concurrent users.

### Recommendations
- Implement more specific error codes for different types of invalid requests.
- Consider scaling the backend infrastructure to handle higher loads in peak usage times.
